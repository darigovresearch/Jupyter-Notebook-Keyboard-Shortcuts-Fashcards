# Jupyter-Notebook-Keyboard-Shortcuts-flashcards
Repository containing Anki Flashcards &amp; source code to revise Jupyter Notebook Keyboard shortcuts

## Introduction
This repository has taken keyboard shortcuts outlined in the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html?highlight=keyboard%20shortcut#keyboard-shortcuts) help menu by the Jupyter team and put them into a form which can be easily learnt/revised using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> a cross platform app specifically designed for long term knowledge retention.

## Notes
Please note the modifications which have been made & where you can find updates.
1. The front of most cards has either "(Edit Mode)" or "(Command Mode)" appended to the end so that you know which context you must be in for the keyboard shortcut functionality to work.
2. Any updates, translations or corrections to the deck will be available at <a href="https://github.com/darigovresearch/Jupyter-Notebook-Keyboard-Shortcuts-Fashcards/">https://github.com/darigovresearch/Jupyter-Notebook-Keyboard-Shortcuts-Fashcards/</a> so do return periodically to check if you have the latest version.

Feel free to share the deck and give the repository a star so more people are likely to see this work and can get the most out of it.

## Usage
If you want to just learn the words, download <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> on your device of choice and open the .apkg file to add it into your collection. If you wish to build the deck from scratch you will need to import the .csv file via the desktop with HTML enabled and the separator to be ";".

## Potential Improvements Yet to be Made
1. To find a way to systematically pull the definitions from the source so that any corrections or additions are automatically updated.
2. To translate the deck into different languages so people around the world can learn about the topic. All translations will be found in the link above & we are happy to incorporate any translations that have been submitted.
